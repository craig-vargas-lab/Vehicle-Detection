# Vehicle Detection

This repository contains an experiment to show a use case for computer vision tequniques applied to detecting other vehicles on the road.  Information about the experiment can be found in the [Write-up](./writeup.md)

Instructions on how to replicate the experiment will come in the future once I get time to better document the process.  The code is commented so you are welcome dig in.
